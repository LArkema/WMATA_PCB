[![Compile and Release Binary](https://github.com/LArkema/dctransistor-project/actions/workflows/compile-sketches.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/LArkema/dctransistor-project/actions/workflows/compile-sketches.yml)

Project to make a PCB version of the WMATA metro map that tracks train positions using LEDs. Repository currently contains source code for DCTransistor boards (source code for board design and schematics coming soon).

For more information on DCTransistor Boards, visit the [website](https://dctransistor.com)

This repository is a bit messy and needs to be cleaned up. That said, the source code running on the boards is currently under the `test_code` folder.
