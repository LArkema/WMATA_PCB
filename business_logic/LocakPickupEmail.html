      Hello <?= name ?>,
    </p>
    <p> 
      Thank you for ordering your DCTransistor board! Order <a href=<?= receipt_url ?>><?= receipt_num ?></a> has been sucessfully processed. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Since you selected local pickup, you <a href=https://dctransistor.com/terms-and-privacy/#local-pickup>should</a> have already sent an email to this address to coordinate a pickup. If you have not, you may respond to this email to try and setup a pickup - however, local pickup is not guaranteed and you will be responsible for paying an additional shipping fee if a pickup cannot be arranged.
    </p>
    <p>
      When your board arrives, setup your new board using the <a href=https://dctransistor.com/setup/>setup instructions</a> on the DCTransistor website. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Thank you again for your order! This passion project primarily spreads through word of mouth, so please share with your DC Transit enthusiast friends!<br>
      Logan
